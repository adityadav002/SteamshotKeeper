## FAQ

### What is the API method?
The API is a tidier option that makes use of the data-access facilities provided by Steam. However, it requires obtaining a personal API key.

### What is the HTML crawler method?
The crawler searches the screenshot gallery for links to the image files by examining the source code of the pages.
Disadvantages: potentially more time-consuming, less reliable, and no access to hidden metadata.
Advantage: no API access required.

### How do I obtain an API key?
Steam grants every active user a free API key. Click on the "API key" link within the programme window, or open the page directly in your browser: [https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey)

### Where is my Steam name / API key stored?
This is determined by QSettings, probably in the registry (regedit) under the key `Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Alsweider\SteamshotKeeper`.
